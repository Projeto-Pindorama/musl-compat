# musl-compat
Legacy compatibility headers for the musl libc.

## Who's the responsible?
All kudos for the C language source code goes to the NetBSD and OpenBSD
team â€” read the copyright header of each file for more information.  

All kudos for the original packaging (in fact, taking these headers,
testing it etc) goes to the Void Linux team.  

And, for last but not least, the `do_install.ksh` script was made
entirely by me, so if you have any problems with this script, blame it
on me. :^)
